331336	Mural, Zheng He and Columbus by Guan Wei, 2006 - 2007	2010/5/1	Mural painting, 'Zheng He and Columbus', acrylic on medium density fibre board (MDF), painted by Guan Wei for the exhibition, 'Other histories:Guan Wei's fable for a contemporary world', Powerhouse Museum, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia, 2006-2007 A mural depicting a section of the globe and constellation against a black background. This mural was painted in two parts on medium density fibre (MDF) board and needs to be displayed together.

A hand and red arrow point to the left. The painting includes many human figures and a mysterious animal. This particular mural painting was displayed at the beginning of the exhibition as an introduction and shows discovery stories of Australia both by Zheng He(1371-1432) from the East and Christopher Columbus (1451-1506) from the West. It depicts constellations with a mysterious animal which allude to the Chinese percept of the connection between the Star of Longevity (Lao Shou Xing) and the Museum's object, the God of Longevity figurine (Shou Lao). In East Asia, the Canopus was believed to be the Star of Longevity. It was believed that this star came down to the earth and became the God of Longevity.		2006 - 2007	: unknown; 2006 - 2007|		Murals|Pictorials	http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=331336						This text content licensed under<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/au/" rel="license" about="http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=331336#_cc-by-sa_content">CC BY-SA</a>.
402264	Chocolate wrapping machine with foil samples, 1949	2010/4/1	Wrapping machine and samples of foil for wrapping chocolates (5), metal / plastic / timber / fabric belt / metal foil, machine made by Forgrove Machinery Co Ltd, Leeds, England, 1949, used by Dullo Chocolates at Zetland, New South Wales, Australia, 1997-2001 The machine is driven by a Crompton Parkinson electric motor. Before it is turned on, a reel of foil is installed on a timber spool and the end of the foil is fed into a cutting mechanism. Once the machine is on, the foil is fed automatically through the cutter, and rectangles of foil are positioned, one at a time, to receive individual chocolates. Chocolates are fed by hand continuously into a metal ring that rests on a table; there are two rings with the machine, one holding round-based chocolates and the other holding triangular-based chocolates. The ring revolves to present each chocolate in turn to a rod that sits below the table. The rod pushes the chocolate up to the foil, which is wrapped around it. A small set of jaws grabs the wrapped chocolate and feeds it under a foam plastic roller, which gently tamps it to complete the operation. The step-wise action of the machine is controlled by a cam, which actuates a horizontal Geneva wheel. Many parts of the machine are painted dark red.

371684	Two (2) albums of photographs by Serge Vargassoff Hong Kong, 1940 - 1949	2009/104/2	Photograph albums, (2), black and white photographic prints of Asian artefacts, cardboard / photographic paper, made by Serge Vargassoff, Hong Kong, 1940s. These two albums of photographs of Asian artefacts taken by Serge Vargassoff each contain approximately 100 photographs. The images document various antiques such as ceramics, paintings and bronze statues. It is likely that they were taken as a visual record of particular objects, perhaps with the intention of publication. The objects are recorded in the captions as being from the personal collections of H.E Marquis Taliani De Marchio, General G. Bagulesch, Consten, Dr. Haas, J.P. Dubosc, M. He J.J Brandt, Vargohini, Mario Prodan, M.Komor, and Li Hsing-An. The portrait format albums have thick, heavily worn cardboard covers. The pages of the albums are made of brown card, and they are bound on the lefthand side. One album has a grey cardboard cover bound with screws though two of three screws are missing. The album contains photographs of artefacts including jades, tapestries and Christian paintings. It includes 7 loose photographs, 3 of which are stamped "COPYRIGHT SERGE VARGASSOFF" on the reverse. The other album has a black cover and is bound with two screws. It contains photographs of artefacts including ivories, stone carvings, lacquers, paintings, jades and craft studio shots taken in c.1939. Most of the photographs are identified by a handwritten numeral and are mounted in the albums in ascending numerical order. As the photographs were taken between 1900 and 1960, they are black-and-white silver gelatin prints. The prints are pasted to the pages with glue. In each photograph the image is surrounded by a white border. The border was the result of the photographic paper being held in a special holder during enlargement, a technique that was not commonly employed until about the mid-1910s.

371648	Photograph albums by Serge Vargassoff, 1930 - 1949	2009/104/1	Five (5) volumes of photographic prints 'Views', cardboard / cloth / metal, made by Serge Vargassoff, Peking, China, 1930s and 1940s These five albums of photographs of China by Serge Vargassoff each contain approximately 1,000 photographs. The images show various landscape, architectural and genre scenes taken in and around Peking (Beijing), China. All five albums are landscape format and have thick cloth-covered cardboard covers. The pages of the albums are made of black card. They are bound on the left hand side with metal pinfastenings, some of which have been replaced with black string. The photographs are each identified by a handwritten numeral and some with captions and are mounted in the albums in ascending numerical order. The photographs are numbered consecutively from album to album which provides their sequencing (though the album with Views 1,000-2,000 is missing). As the photographs were taken between 1900 and 1960, they are black-and-white silver gelatin prints. The prints are pasted to the pages with glue. In each photograph the image is surrounded by a white border. The border was the result of the photographic paper being held in a special holder during enlargement, a technique that was not commonly employed until about the mid-1910s. Details of the five albums are as follows: on the cover of the first album "Views Nos. 1-1000" has been embossed in glided letters in the centre and "Photographs by S. Vargassoff" at the bottom right corner. Subjects photographed in this album include Tatung (Datong), Shansi (Shanxi) and Yun Kan Caves (Yungang Caves) dated 1931, Peking dated 1932, air views of Peking (Beijing), Tientsin (Tianjin), Pei Tai Ho (Beidai he) Shang Hai Kuan (Shanhai guan) and Mukden (Shenyang). Albums 2 to 5 have been similary labelled. The second album is marked "Views No. 2001-3000 PHOTOGRAPHS BY SERGE VARGASSOFF". Subjects photographed in this album include Sui Yuan (Suiyuan), Tatung caves (Datong caves), Belgian Embassy, Russian cemetery, Yenching University (Yanjing University), Fai Hi Ssu (Faihai Si Temple) and Pi Yun Ssu (Biyun Si Temple). The third album has embossed text "Views Nos. 3001-4000 Photographs by Serge Vargassoff". Subjects photographed include Yellow Palace, Summer Palace, Yu Chin Kuan (Yujin Guan), Pa Ta Chu (Badachu), Pi Yun Ssu (Biyun Si Temple), Wu Tai Shan (Wutai Shan Mountain), Nan Hsiao Chieh (Nanxiao Jie Street), Wo Fo Ssu, Pi Yun Ssu, Wan Shan Tien, Wu Tai Shan, Jehol, Pan Tao Kung, Pei Hai, Chinese Houses and Courtyards.

400280	Sony DVR-1000, Digital Video Recorder, 1987	2009/103/2	Digital videotape recorder, DVR-1000, metal / plastic / electronic components, made by Sony, Tokyo, Japan, 1987 The object consists in two packages one seated on top of the other. In the upper package are the Video Tape Recorder with cassette entry, machine control panel, LCD menu display and other function controls on the front, video, audio and control system connectors on the rear. The lower package is a cabinet full of electronic circuit cards, with data processing, frame storage and error correction boards in a rack frame. This is Sony's entry into the digital videotape market. Announced in September 1986 and shown at the US National Association of Broadcaster's (NAB) convention in March, 1987, it was the first machine that could record full format 4:2:2 CCIR-601 (also known as D1) digital component video signals without compression. It used a 19mm wide tape housed in a cassette. The recorder used helical scan video read/write heads to write to the tape.

400279	Silicon Graphics Onyx I graphics computer, 1994	2009/103/1	Computer, graphics production, Silicon Graphics Onyx 1, metal / plastic / electronic components, made by Silicon Graphics Inc, Sunnyvale, California, United States of America, 1994 The Onyx-1 is a 1.5m high by 0.75m wide rack cabinet of electronics containing numerous circuit boards, a power supply and cooling system. It has a decorative front surface, grey side panels and a rear panel with numerous data and video signal connectors. It is a specialised graphics workstation that uses the 'geometry engine' very-large scale integrated circuit (VLSI) developed by James Clark, the founder of SGI. The Geometry engine does the mathematically intensive tasks necessary for the generation of 2-D and 3-D images in a computer graphics system. These tasks are the matrix manipulations required for moving, rotating and doing perspective transformations of an object, clipping the object to fit the frame of the viewing 'window' and the scaling of the relative size of the object so that it fits the requirements of the particular type of output system utilised, e.g. film or videotape. It thus takes the load off the CPU for mathematically intensive commands. The version of the geometry engine used in this machine was known as a Reality Engine. The processing section is a parallel multi-processor computer, capable of accommodating up to 24 processors. The processor used was the MIPS R4400, a 150MHz clock, pipelined instruction processing, 64-bit data path chip released in 1993. The basic configuration of the machine consisted in a 4 processor board with slots for an extra 5 boards. It could utilise up to 16-gigabytes of memory and included a 2-GB hard disk drive. The operating system was IRIX, a variation of Unix specially developed by SGI to maximise the functionality of their geometry engine graphics processor.

382632	Corrugated iron curving machine, 1900 - 1950	2009/98/1	Corrugated iron curving machine, iron, maker unknown, [1900-1950], used by Graham Clegg, Young, New South Wales, Australia, 1975 - 1990 The machine is manually operated. It comprises a cast iron and wrought iron frame containing three corrugated rollers, a drive system and means of adjusting the amount of curve produced. The operator turns a large handwheel, which has a thickened rim to provide inertia once in motion. Power is transmitted to the lower rollers by reduction spur gearing. The lower two rollers lie in the same plane and are powered but are not adjustable. The upper roller is not powered, but obtains its rotation from the material passing through the machine. The upper roller is adjustable in height via a handwheel and bevel gear set. This adjustment controls the amount of "pinch", or bending pressure applied to the material travelling over the lower rollers, and thus the curvature produced. In operation, the iron is gradually brought to the correct curvature by small increments in a succession of passes. For example a 10ft (3 metre) sheet might require 7 or 8 passes to bring it to a half circle. This machine also carries a flat pulley at the end of the input shaft. This may be an attempt to supply a power drive. However the pulley is far too small in diameter to give the correct speed ratio from commonly used power sources, so its existence probably signifies an impractical and failed attempt.		1900 - 1950	: unknown; 1900 - 1950|		Agricultural machines|Agricultural Equipment	http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=382632						This text content licensed under<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/au/" rel="license" about="http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=382632#_cc-by-sa_content">CC BY-SA</a>.

Forming a low square neckline above the centre panel, a strip of maroon fabric with printed gold leaf design features a strand of mock pearls with one larger tear shaped mock pearl at the centre. There is a floral patterned black lace panel between the bodice and high neckline which has a two tiered standing collar. A velvet band around the neckline fastens with gold safety pin at centre back and features a fine strand of small mock pearls, with strands of thicker mock pearls on either side. The centre back opening to hip fastens with plastic flower shaped buttons and ribbon loops. A floor length black chiffon cape attaches to each shoulder, although the left is currently partially detached. It is embellished with strands of mock pearls at each shoulder.

372900	KUKAC 1 computer, 1965 - 1975	2010/1/104	Electronic computer, cords and related papers, KUKAC 1, metal / plastic / paper / Bakelite, designed and made by Allan Bromley, Australia, c. 1970 This is a digital computer, using a 16-bit word size. This size was adopted, because it was simple and economic and well supported by current MSI components. The computer has three functional components: a scratch pad, an arithmetic logic unit, and an input-output bus and memory. The scratch pad consists of twelve general-purpose and four special-purpose shift registers. The logic unit performs operations on the contents of selected scratch pad registers. All arithmetic is performed using standard 2-complement logic, bit-serial techniques. The main memory is 512 words, which may be expanded in increments of 256 words. It is assembled from MOS LSI shift registers, giving an effective memory cost of around 1 cent per bit. Standard modules are used, and wiring is point-to-point. A number of integrated circuits (ICs) were installed on homemade circuit boards. A cassette recorder is used for storage back-up. The equipment included a digital to analogue converter to drive the display. Paper tape reader and punch were also required, as a number of instructions were stored on punch cards. Professor Bromley suggested that a modified television set could be used as a simple output device and to display the operation of the computer. He suggested that a cassette recorder could be used to back-up the store, a cheap electric typewriter could provide hard copy output, and a calculator for keyboard and display. The computer is housed in a box with metal finish, side, bottom and top in a 19 inch rack. Switches, instructions on punch cards at the front. There are 14 cards with integrated circuits.

372869	Meccano spirograph, 1970 - 1975	2010/1/88	Meccano model of spirograph with a cork cube for pins and five spirograph drawings, metal / wood / plastic / paper. made by Allan Bromley, Australia, 1970-1975 A Meccano model of a spirograph machine, made of metal, wood and paper, consists of a cube shaped structure made of metal Meccano pieces and screws with four small circular brass feet at each corner of the base. On one side of the model there is a wooden box attached with small drill holes on the top, left hand side and back side and on the front side there is an ON/OFF switch and written in red pen it reads, 'ON / OFF' and to the right, 'CAUTION / 240 VOLTS'. Attached to this wooden box is a white electrical cord with a brown splug. Underneath the metal structure are cogs, chains and metal rods. Sitting on the top os the metal structure are two circular cogs, attached to which are metal rods connected with screws and metal Meccano pieces, they join in the top centre where a drawing instrument can be secured. Under this is a circular cork base to hold a circular piece of paper onto which the spirograph is drawn. This spirograph is electrically powered by a small motor. It works in the same fashion as a conventional 'pen powered' spirograph template in that it produces mathematical curves of the variety technically known as hypotrochoids and epitrochoids, except the gears are powered by the motor. A cork cube with pins inserted into top, made of cork, metal and plastic. Cube includes a semi-circular shape cut out of the top middle, with four brown top sewing pins on one side of the cut out shape and four black pins on the other and in the cut out middle there are seven red top pins and one blue top pin. On the base it is written in black pen, 'ALLAN G / BROMLEY'. Five spirograph drawings, made of black pen and paper, consists of a circular piece of cream paper with a spriograph drawing on each side in black pen. Around the edge of the paper are pin holes where it was secured onto the spirograph machine.		1970 - 1975	Maker: unknown; Sydney, New South Wales; 1970 - 1975|	Made: unknown; Sydney, New South Wales; 1970 - 1975|	Models|Models	http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=372869	225 mm	230 mm				This text content licensed under<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/au/" rel="license" about="http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=372869#_cc-by-sa_content">CC BY-SA</a>.
372867	Sound-Ranging Comparator Mark IV, 1930 - 1949	2010/1/87	Sound-ranging comparator Mark IV, metal, glass, maker unknown, c. 1930s, 1940s. The object of sound ranging is to direct effective fire on a source of explosive sound in the enemy lines. This source is normally a hostile gun troop which should be neutralised immediately by a heavy concentration of fire or registered for future neutralisation. Prior to using the comparator the sound ranging organization would have obtained records showing an approximate location of the area of enemy activity, as well as having knowledge of shell bursts, fired by a co-operating gun. A line of microphones is used to record the sound of a shell blast, and observations would be based on the comparator, which is adjusted to find 'line of best fit' from which an increment in range over or under a line left or right can be read. A number of sliding rulers are adjustable by hand, seen through a clear glass plate, which turns. The comparator also has a diameter cursor. An adjustable scale is read through the glass. A mechanism on the side of the assembly adjusts the scales together. The gun-to-target line is plotted and the angles subtended at the enemy gun between the various microphones and the gun-to-target line is measured. This is a Mark IV, 1941 vintage, noting that the Artillery Museum at North Head of Sydney Harbour also has a Mark IV of this instrument.	The instrument is marked OS 841 GA.	1930 - 1949	: unknown; 1930 - 1949|		Calculating devices|Military equipment|Calculating Instruments	http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=372867	280 mm		350 mm			This text content licensed under<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/au/" rel="license" about="http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=372867#_cc-by-sa_content">CC BY-SA</a>.
372866	Sound ranging comparator, 1930 - 1949	2010/1/86	Sound ranging comparator (Mark II). wood / metal, maker unknown, c. 1930s -early 1940s. A line of microphones is used to record sound of a shell blast, artillery fire, etc. The objective of ranging by sound ranging methods is to bring effective fire to bear on a source of explosive sound in the enemy lines. The source of this sound is normally a hostile gun troop which desirably should be neutralised immediately, or registered for future neutralisation by a heavy concentration of fire. If the positions of the ranging gun and the enemy gun are known, it is possible to plot the gun-target line and obtain the angles subtended at the enemy gun between the various microphones and this line. 6 dials are connected by fine string to rotating grid. 2 semi-circular scales with cursors are connected to the string, sliding along the scale. The semi-circular scale at the top can be rotated 180 degrees through the plane at right angle to the cable. This is a Mark II instrument, (see also sound-ranging comparator Mark IV). The instrument is mounted on a wooden base.		1930 - 1949	: unknown; 1930 - 1949|		Calculating devices|Military equipment|Calculating Instruments	http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=372866	65 mm		340 mm			This text content licensed under<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/au/" rel="license" about="http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=372866#_cc-by-sa_content">CC BY-SA</a>.
372868	Pershing missile guidance computer, 1960 - 1969	2010/1/85	Electro-mechanical analogue computer, Missile Guidance Computer, metal / plastic / insulation, made by the E-P Division of the Bendix Corporation, United States of America, 1960s This is an analogue mechanical computer, designed for the Pershing missile programme. It is packed in a small cast metal box with mechanical and discrete electronic components. The box was mounted on the frame of the missile. The computer was manufactured by the E-P Division of the Bendix Corporation in USA, Contract DA-30-069-AMC-6(Z), Army Missile Command, Pershing Missile guidance Corp. Part Number 10586500-39, Mod. 4G&C, Serial No. 303. Weight 56.8 (lbs?). Early feasibility studies of a new long range missile system were begun soon after 1956. Within the resulting Pershing programme the Army developed a 2-stage solid fuel missile with a range of 800 miles, named after General 'Black Jack' Pershing. The development contract was given to Martin Marietta Aerospace, Orlando Division in Florida. The first deployment of Pershing I took place in 1963, and an improved model started to replace it from 1969. A further improved model, Pershing II was first deployed in 1983. The increased range and pinpoint accuracy of the Pershing II were major factors influencing the Soviet Union's decision to seek the Treaty on Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces, in which the USA and the USSR agreed to eliminate an entire class of nuclear missiles. An inertial guidance system controls movement of the fins to steer the missile. To measure direction, this system uses three on-board gyroscopes, placed so they form 90 degrees angles with each others. Changes in speed and direction are measured by accelerometers. A computer uses this information to calculate the missile's position and guide it on its course. Each gyroscope is supported by gimbals so it stays in position as the vehicle rolls, pitches or turns. The equipment is housed in a cast metal box, military green, mechanical and electrical components. It uses discrete components, no integrated circuits.		1960 - 1969	: unknown; 1960 - 1969|		Analog computers|Calculating Instruments	http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=372868	250 mm	440 mm	500 mm			This text content licensed under<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/au/" rel="license" about="http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=372868#_cc-by-sa_content">CC BY-SA</a>.

371863	Analogue Computer, EAI 180, 1972	2010/1/21	Analogue computer, EAI180, wood / metal / glass / cable / plastic, made by EAI (Electronics Associates Incorporated), Australia, 1972 This is a hybrid mechanical/electronic analogue computer. It was made in Australia by EAI Australia for the Australian market and for export. The EAI 180 is a low cost system for modelling a variety of communications systems. For this purpose it contains the necessary signal generators, signal processors and measuring equipment in both the time and the frequency domain. The EAI 180 can be expanded from a small system capable of solving a second order differential equation to having sufficient computing and logic power to solve an automatic optimisation and plotting of three differential equations. The equipment is housed in a cabinet, which has 5 panels: top panel has a column of plugholes for integrators and dual summers; there are 12 red overload indicator lights and an amplifier selector; a digit readout system is an integral part of the system, providing a reliable display of amplifier balance and output; functions are selected by four push buttons; panel 2 is as the top panel; panel 3 has rows of potentiometers (18) and a number of plugs for op-amps; panel 4 has 10 potentiometers for setting variables; panel 5 has a number of plugs for flip-flops and gates; at the bottom there is a drawer for jacks and other equipment. At the time, EAI Australia marketed very well in Europe, but the American mother company would not allow it to export to the USA. Professor Bromley stated that the Australian computer was better than the American models; it was very flexible, and was used for teaching, in medical laboratories, etc.		1972	: unknown; 1972|		Analog computers|Calculating Instruments	http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=371863						This text content licensed under<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/au/" rel="license" about="http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=371863#_cc-by-sa_content">CC BY-SA</a>.

Scales: Various indicators of load (weight) for different compartments and the materials to be loaded therein. Each item to be stored on the aircraft, including fuel, bombs and crew, has a weight which adds to a shift in the balance of the aircraft (the centre of gravity) away from its centre line thus tending to cause it to turn towards the point of this mass. This is the turning "moment" of the load. The accumulation of various loads in different parts of the aircraft needs to be balanced out so that the aircraft's tendency to stray from its course is minimised. The scales are not logarithmic but simple linear scales because the rule's function is to add the moments as they are distributed over the aircraft. Bromley note: Not really a slide rule, but a means of adding moments for loadings in various aircraft compartments. (Serves the same purpose as "Librascope")	Face: Load Adjuster - Loading Range - B-24D,E,G,H, & J - PB24Y-1, plus scale labels for various locations in aircraft.

This type of calculator follows the principle developed by Blaise Pascal for adding devices except that subtraction is easier since the dials can be turned in both directions. The dials have holes punched into them which rotate with a stylus (which remains with the calculator) thus acting as counters. Each counter (except the highest dial) has a carry mechanism which propagates the count into the next higher digit dial. The right most dial counts in 1/8ths of an inch and the next left dial counts to 12 for calculations involving measurements in feet and inches. There is a lever in the body of the calculator which when pulled resets all counting dials to zero. There is a ruler marked in inches and 1/16ths of an inch at the top edge. Instructions on the edge of the body of the calculator: (+) To Add - use large figures - Turn to right (-) To Subtract - use small figures - Turn to left	on face: Addometer on bottom edge: Patents Pending in USA and Foreign Countries Reliable Typewriter & Adding Machine Corporation - Made in USA	1920 - 1960	: unknown; 1920 - 1960|		Mechanical calculators|Measuring Instruments	http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=383152	10 mm	60 mm				This text content licensed under<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/au/" rel="license" about="http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=383152#_cc-by-sa_content">CC BY-SA</a>.

This carriage may be positioned along the tracing arm for the scale of the curve being measured. The accumulator wheel is the moving part that touches the table. There is a metal tracing pointer at the other end of the tracing arm. As the pointer is moved around the perimeter of the curve whose area is being measured the steel rim of the accumulator wheel rolls forwards or backwards and skids sideways. The scale is on the wheel itself, and indicates how far the wheel has turned. The final dial reading represents the sum of all the rim's rolling motions. This number is proportional to the area of the region.	The accumulator wheel and vernier carriage has the instrument number: 37324. The tracing arm has a scale marked from 5 to 16 in fine gradations of ten marks between each numbered scale. The case has a calibration chart glued in to the lid.	1947	: unknown; 1947|		Measuring instruments|Calculating Instruments	http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=372092		100 mm	44 mm			This text content licensed under<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/au/" rel="license" about="http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=372092#_cc-by-sa_content">CC BY-SA</a>.

382818	Pitkin Chronograph No 324, 1900 - 1925	2010/1/499	Calculating rule, Chronograph No 324, metal, made by James Pitkin and Co Ltd, London, England, early 20th century Mfr: James Pitkin & Co. Ltd, Makers, London Chronograph No.324 The Pitkin chronograph is a tool for calculating the muzzle velocity of a projectile when determining the ballistic characteristics of a gun. It consists of a long, narrow metal rule. At one end is a pivot point or rotating joint that allows the rule to turn through a full circle or to swing upwards from the horizontal. It has a double cursor-like rider one half of which has a vernier scale fixable with a knurled knob and having a knife edge set at right angles to the rule. The knife edge can be replaced by undoing a pair of screws and can be very precisely positioned. The other half of the cursor rider consists of a block of metal which can be set at a fixed distance from the vernier rider by a worm screw and also has a knurled knob to lock its position Scales: Edge, upper: Heights (in inches: 0 - 21.5) Edge, lower: Velocities - Feet per Second Gauge mark: Disjunction Screen Distance 120 feet This device is used in association with a Boulenge chronograph, in which two screens are placed in front of the gun one at the muzzle and one 120 feet away. In a Boulenge chronograph a rod is released by the breaking of an electric wire (the 'screen') placed at the muzzle and on the breaking of the second screen, 120 feet from the first, the drop of a second rod starts. The first rod has a knife on it which marks the second rod when the knife falls onto it. The time that elapses between the breaking of the two screens by the projectile is measured by the fall of the rod and the velocity of the projectile can be calculated from the duration of this interval, given that the distance of travel is known to be the distance between the two screens or 120 feet.

Ltd, Makers, London Chronograph No.324	1900 - 1925	: unknown; 1900 - 1925|		Slide rules|Calculating Instruments	http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=382818	6 mm	20 mm				This text content licensed under<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/au/" rel="license" about="http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=382818#_cc-by-sa_content">CC BY-SA</a>.

The Magnameta oil tonnage calculator with instructions in wooden case, paper, wood, plastic, metal. Manufacturer: The Magnameta Co, Oasthouse Way, St Mary Cray, Kent, UK. Two pairs of long strips of light timber laminated to similar strips of slightly lesser width then laminated to a full length and width plastic (Perspex) panel for support. There are two more long strips of timber laminated underneath that function as supports for the whole. The slide is a single piece of timber that runs between the two long strips and is held by the undercut of the inner layer of timber on the side pieces. It is shorter than the main body of the rule. The slide has a slot cut into it through which a clamping wing nut locks the position of the large, chromed metal (nickel?) bounded, clear acetate cursor. The scales are printed on paper which is bonded to the top surfaces of the wooden panels of the rule. Scales: Upper stock: A: Barrels as One Tenth Scale Reading - in units of 'Cubic Feet in Thousands' and 'Tons As One Hundredth Scale Reading' Slide, upper: B: Specific gravity of the petroleum Slide, middle: C: ditto Slide, lower: D: API (American Petroleum Institute) gravity values Lower Stock: E: Ten times Scale Reading - Tons in Hundreds This slide rule was used for calculations required in the loading of oil tankers. The slide rule is large to allow greater precision. It is intended for use during the actual tanker loading process and is said to be "accurate enough to load the ship by" [Instruction booklet]. The cursor may be locked in position at a set gravity value of the oil being loaded, so that with a known specific gravity, say 900, a tank of 25,000 cubic feet will weigh 625 long, 635 metric or 700 short tons, (when using the appropriate gauge markers on the slide). The E scale may also be used to find the weight in American barrels. The slide rule was invented by C.J. Sangwin and patented in 1963. British Patent GB919063.

156238	Alcohol Proofing slide rule by T Gill of London, 1775 - 1799	2010/1/397	Slide rule, alcohol proofing, ivory / electrum, made by T Gill, London, England, late 1700s Ivory Gauging rule by T. Gill of London The stock is a single sheet of ivory. The slides are a pair of slivers of ivory secured by two screws that pass through a central slot in the stock. Both the slides and the stock are engraved with scales for alcohol proof calculations. Scales: At the top left of either side there is a scale on the slide which is to be set against a fleur-de-lys index marker on the stock. This is the adjustment for the temperature of the liquor. The rest of the stock is occupied by a series of increasing ranges of a scale of Proof. The 1st scale runs from a Water gauge point of 100 (no alcohol in the solution) to 80. The 2nd scale ranges from 80 down to a star gauge index at 16 (at which point the liquor was considered seizable for being too much underproof, ie, below an adequate alcohol content) and then to a Proof gauge point of 0 and on to an overproof level of 10. The 3rd scale (now on the opposite side of the rule) ranges from 20 underproof to 28 overproof through a Proof index point at 0. The 4th scale ranges from 20 overproof to 67 overproof with a Proof index of 66.5. The two scales on this side are of much greater precision than those on the first side. The hydrometer weight values read from the liquor using the hydrometer are applied to the slides on each side in four increasing ranges. On the 1st side the 1st hydrometer scale runs from 0 - 13, the 2nd runs from 11 - 80. On the 2nd side the 3rd scale runs from 30 - 100 and the 4th scale runs from 93 - 180. The scales on the outer edge show the strengths of alcohol as measured by another type of hydrometer known as Clark's hydrometer. The gauge point SW marks the strength of a very good Spirits of Wine.

Bromley suggests c.1790. 30.5 cm x 2.8 cm x 0.4 cm The Gunter's Rule was the precursor to the slide rule as it has no slide. Values in the scales are placed as the logarithm of the number. Arithmetic functions were performed by opening a divider to the width of the first number and then reading off the value of the result by placing one leg of the open divider at the second number, the extended leg of the divider then points to the result value. The slide rule developed by placing a pair of Gunter's rules together and reading the result by placing a hairline across the pair of rules.	scale values and mnemonics.	1785 - 1795	: unknown; 1785 - 1795|		Calculating devices|Calculating Instruments	http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=319138						This text content licensed under<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/au/" rel="license" about="http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=319138#_cc-by-sa_content">CC BY-SA</a>.

One face has 8 Centronics connectors arrayed on it in pairs. There is a label block in the middke of this face. It has not been opened but should contain a set of core memory frames similar to those covered in P.159/94. This memory block is said to have been part of the KDF9 at the Basser Department of Computer Science at the University of Sydney. The KDF9 was one of the first computers to have a full pre-emptive operating system. The computer had up to 32 kilobytes of memory - there were no discs, backing storage was provided by magnetic tape units that could be partially rewound and overwritten. The software system known as the Director was sophisticated for its time, because it provided fully pre-emptive process switching.

From the frame is suspended a shaft adder, which has five different gears and six sprockets, representing different multiples of the unit price (50 pence), i.e., 50 p, 1 pound, 2 pounds, etc. The differentials act as adders of the value of the ticket, and the ticket machine sends a signal, which through the relays releases the cog relating to the value of the ticket. There were no springs; if power should be lost, tickets paid would be honoured. The accumulator was used for Win and Place betting. This unit comes from the Julius Totalisator in Wembley, UK.		1962	: unknown; 1962|		Gambling equipment|Calculating Instruments	http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=374918						This text content licensed under<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/au/" rel="license" about="http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=374918#_cc-by-sa_content">CC BY-SA</a>.

This object is a Zero-setting Compensating Planimeter in a blacked metal case with polyurethane foam cutout instrument support in body of case and lid, plus instruction manual. Note: polyurethane is breaking down. Similar to a polar planimeter, the supporting arm is anchored to the work table with a short cylinder having a sharp point like a compass needle. It is linked to the tracing arm with a ball headed pin that forms an elbow hinge, locking it into the vernier carriage. The vernier carriage holds the accumulator wheel and vernier in a transparent plastic box which may be positioned along the tracing arm for the scale of the curve being measured. The accumulator wheel is the moving part that touches the table. At the tracing end the arm has a magnifying glass cursor. As the pointer is moved around the perimeter of the curve whose area is being measured the steel rim rolls forwards or backwards and skids sideways. The scale is on the wheel itself, and indicates how far the wheel has turned. The final dial reading represents the sum of all the rim's rolling motions. This number is proportional to the area of the region.	The tracing arm has the instrument number: 8306, and a scale marked from 4 to 16 in fine gradations of ten marks between each numbered scale. There is a calibration chart with the instrument.

372081	Allbrit planimeter	2010/1/176	Polar planimeter in case, Allbrit, steel, /plastic / glass / leatherette, W.F. Stanley, London, mid-20th century. This object is an Amsler-type polar Planimeter in a blue velvet lined leatherette case. A supporting arm is anchored to the work table with a short cylinder having a sharp point like a compass needle. It is linked to the tracing arm with a ball headed pin that forms an elbow hinge. The tracing arm has at one end a carriage consisting in a pair of supports that hold between them the accumulator wheel and vernier. This carriage may be positioned along the tracing arm for the scale of the curve being measured. The accumulator wheel is the moving part that touches the table. At the tracing end the arm has a magnifying glass cursor. As the pointer is moved around the perimeter of the curve whose area is being measured the steel rim rolls forwards or backwards and skids sideways. The scale is on the wheel itself, and indicates how far the wheel has turned. The final dial reading represents the sum of all the rim's rolling motions. This number is proportional to the area of the region.	The accumulator wheel and vernier carriage has the instrument number: 38870. The tracing arm has a scale marked from 21 to 68 in fine gradations of ten marks between each numbered scale. The case has a calibration chart glued into its lid.

371988	Bow planimeter, 1875 - 1899	2010/1/173	Planimeter with case, Amsler bow type, stainless steel / leatherette, made by the American Steam Gauge Company, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America, late 19th century Amsler bow type Planimeter in purple velvet lined leatherette box. It has two rods joined by a hinge with a rotating steel wheel at the hinge which is dragged and rotated as the pointer at the end of the tracing rod is drawn around the area to be measured. The end of the other rod is supported by a short cylindrical mass. The whole is contained in a purpose built purple velvet lined leatherette case with rounded ends. This type of planimeter was used for calculating the mean effective pressure (MEP) of a steam engine. Steam pressure is indicated on a diagram or "card" in which the x-axis is the piston position as it moves through the engine stroke, and the y-axis records the pressure within the cylinder. Once the diagram has been recorded the area enclosed by the diagram is measured with the planimeter. The result is then divided by the length of the engine stroke to get the MEP.	on case: Made by American Steam Gauge Co., Boston, Mass	1875 - 1899	: unknown; 1875 - 1899|		Measuring instruments|Calculating Instruments	http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=371988		49 mm	36 mm			This text content licensed under<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/au/" rel="license" about="http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=371988#_cc-by-sa_content">CC BY-SA</a>.

The rows of ten beads consist in four natural coloured beads on either side of two central black stained beads. The bowed wires mean that the beads stay to either edge of the device when shifted during operation. The Russian abacus - the Schoty - is not a well known device compared with the soroban or suanpan. Its use is somewhat different giving that it has ten beads in most columns and is thus operated in a rather different manner.		1945 - 1955	: unknown; 1945 - 1955|		Abacus|Calculating Instruments	http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=372324		287 mm	85 mm			This text content licensed under<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/au/" rel="license" about="http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=372324#_cc-by-sa_content">CC BY-SA</a>.

372795	The Adal Calculator	2010/1/129	Spiral mechanical calculator, The Adal Calculator, metal, The Addall Company, Temple Courts, Temple Row, Birmingham, 1910. This object consists in a pair of metal disks and a cursor. The base is a flat aluminium disk with the numbers 00 to 99 around an outer ring which forms a lip. Concentric with this disk and laid upon it, is a thin brass disk which has one hundred small semi-circular indents and the numbers 00 to 99 in a ring around it. The main part of the upper disk is formed into a spiral of 11 turns. There is a tongue of brass attached to the central bolt and having a slot in which a steel ball slides as it accumulates turns of the spiral disk. The slot of the tongue has the numbers 1 to 11 marked on it at intervals equivalent to the step between each turn of the spiral. At its further end is a small clamp which holds it at the zero point of the outer ring so that it acts as a stop for the rotation of the accumulating spiral disk. The whole calculator is held in the flat of the hand. It is a simple adder to 1199 with addends 1-99. The spiral disk is turned by a stylus set into the indent of the number to be added until it reaches the stop. As each number is added the spiral disk rotates and the small steel ball slides in the slot in the tongue indicating the hundreds count of the accumulated result. The total result is thus the number indicated on the tongue (being the hundreds digit) plus the number indicated in the end gap of the stop.

396406	EMS 8 octave filter bank, 1973	2009/83/12	EMS 8 octave filter bank, metal / plastic / electronic components, made by Electronic Music Studios, used by Tristram Cary, England, 1973 The 8 octave filter bank is a device developed by EMS for use with their Synthi 100 system. This version has an extra set of outputs for use with non-Synthi 100 based systems and was used with the various synthesisers in Tristram Cary's private studio in Adelaide. It consists of a 19" (45cm) rack mounted cream-enamelled metal case with controls and output connector sockets on the front panel. The front panel is divided into two parts; the right hand part has 10 output connector sockets which make available the rectified signal level of that component of the audio frequency spectrum at the centre frequency specified by the 8 octaves of the filter bank. There are also a signal input and output connectors. On the left half of the front panel are the gain potentiometers for the eight frequency bands centred at each of the filters' 8 octaves. The octave centre frequencies are 63Hz, 125Hz, 250Hz, 500Hz, 1000Hz, 2000Hz 4000Hz and 8000Hz. Most synthesisers were able to delivers signals to about 10KHz so this range was all that was needed. The EMS specifications for the Synthi 100 indicate that the Octave Filter Bank "consists of eight resonating filters, fixed-tune one octave apart, in the range 62.5 Hz - 8 KHz, separately controllable."	8 Octave Filter Bank Various control labels.	1973	: unknown; 1973|		Electronic musical instruments|Musical Instruments	http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=396406						This text content licensed under<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/au/" rel="license" about="http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=396406#_cc-by-sa_content">CC BY-SA</a>.
396403	Dawe frequency meter counter timer type 3000AR, 1972 - 1976	2009/83/11	Dawe digital frequency meter type 3000AR, metal / glass / plastic / electronic components, made by Dawe, used by Tristram Cary, England, 1972-1976 The Dawe Digital Frequency Meter, Counter and Timer type 3000AR is a device for measuring the frequency of audio signals used with the various synthesisers in Tristram Cary's private studio in Adelaide. It consists in a 19" (45cm) rack mounted cream-enamelled metal case with controls and digit display on the front panel. The front panel is divided into two parts, the right hand part has the controls that set up the meter so that it measures in the range required for the input signal. It has input signal banana plug connectors, two position switches for Normal mode or Accumulate mode operation and for Auto operate or Hold last value state. It has switches to Start, Stop and Reset the count and a rectangular saddle-shaped power switch. On the left hand half of the front panel there are five Nixie tube digit displays and a sixth masked place for a Nixie tube. These show the value of the frequency or the number of counted pulses depending on the mode the instrument is set to. The Dawe appears to have been supplied as part of the original complement of devices included in the EMS Synthi 100. Photographs of the Synthi 100 in the EMS Putney studio (Peter Zinovieff's private studio) show a Synthi 100 with a six digit version of the Dawe frequency counter. Photographs of other Synthi 100s variously show Dawe Frequency Meters or other devices in the same space on the Synthi 100's central panel.

396402	Custom-built digital sequencer for audio synthesisers, 1976	2009/83/10	Custom-built voltage sequencer, metal / plastic / electronic components, maker unknown, used by Tristram Cary, Australia, 1976 This is a custom built digital voltage sequencer with memory used in Tristram Cary's electronic music studio. It is housed in a grey green enamelled metal 19" (45cm) rack mounted box and would have been used to control the frequencies of a voltage controlled oscillator in producing electronic music. It consists in a number of modules that produce the controls and signals that make up its output. The front panel of the device has a set of control blocks laid out on it by which the sequencer is set up and run. 1: Clock control block: Initially a clock control would be set up. This has several toggle switches and a potentiometer. One of the toggle switches selects for the internal clock or an externally supplied clock. The internal clock frequency is controlled by the potentiometer. It can be set to run in forward or reverse modes. A push button switch allows the clock signal to be generated with each push of the button. 2: Sequence Start / End block: This block has two sets of four switches each accompanied by an LED indicator. 3: Voltage setting blocks: there are two blocks Voltage A and Voltage B which set up the assignment of voltage levels to each position of the sequence. Voltage A has 256 levels of voltage set by 8 binary switches, accompanied by LED indicators. The value set by these switches is written into memory by a pushbutton switch. To the right of these 8 switches is a potentiometer marked Scale which sets the voltage range from which each digital numerical range is a proportion. To the right of that is the voltage output connector socket. The Voltage B block has six switches which sets one of 64 values for conversion to a voltage level. Otherwise it functions in the same manner as the Voltage A block. 4: Triggers block: Below the voltage setting blocks are a pair of triggering blocks that set the triggering, or start event, of the A and B setting voltage blocks. Each of these triggers can be set off by one or other of two momentary toggle switches. Their outputs are made available at connector sockets and can be set for either the EMS or Moog synthesisers. 5: At the top left of the panel is a set of 16 LED indicators that show the progress of the sequence. There is a label bottom centre with what may be the initials of the maker and the date of construction, this consists in "TAHL 76". If the 76 is a date code then the sequencer was probably made in Adelaide in 1976 after Cary had been at the Elder Conservatorium for two years. The capacity to drive both EMS and Moog synthesisers is also suggestive of this because the Elder Conservatorium had a Moog synthesiser in its studio as well as Cary's EMS equipment.

There is a severed cable which probably had a multi-pin connector on it that would have plugged into some sort of control panel.		1970 - 1975	: unknown; 1970 - 1975|		Electronic musical instruments|Musical Instruments	http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=396404						This text content licensed under<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/au/" rel="license" about="http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=396404#_cc-by-sa_content">CC BY-SA</a>.
395957	Custom mixer panel, 1968 - 1972	2009/83/6	Mixer panel, custom built, metal / plastic / electronic components, maker unknown, used by Tristram Cary, England, 1968-1972 This is a hand-built mixer panel used in Tristram Cary's Fressingfield studio. It is mounted on a white enamel coated metal plate (approx 30 x 45cm) with numerous controls built into it. Across the top it has a zigzag row of 8 4-position rotary selector switches that select which of four 'treatment return' fader channels are sent to 8 'treatment ratio' potentiometers. The outputs of these ratio controls are buffered using one op-amp integrated circuit per channel and the buffered signals are then sent to the 8 fader controls via bass and treble filter potentiometers. There are also 4 faders labelled 'Main Faders' which have been disconnected but were probably either treatment send faders or recorder and amplifier sends. The faders are all slider-style ribbon potentiometers, with level settings marked in paint in a grid surrounding each fader set. The rotary controls are all standard potentiometers with black plastic knobs on their shafts. There are two cue lamps and two 'Start' toggle switches on the panel between the treatment return faders and the main faders. There are also labels in dymotape at some of the controls which indicate their purpose. On the reverse are the working elements of the various control components, plus a circuit board having the 8 buffer ICs.

395941	Control desk selector panel from Tristram Cary's studio, 1958 - 1962	2009/83/5	Selector panel and control panel, metal / plastic / paper, maker unknown, used by Tristram Cary, England, 1958-1962 This pair of objects are two metal panels used in Tristram Cary's studio as part of his signal routing system. The larger panel was built into the desk above the mixer and was probably used to select tape recorder and other audio signals to one of the fader channels on the mixer. This selection was done with a 6 position rotary switch (no longer attached) and the channels are labelled with coloured paper dots. It also has 4 push-button switches that are labelled "Osc. Remote Control". The smaller panel has 10 holes drilled into it, 6 are labelled 1 - 6 and 4 are labelled with the same coloured dots used on the selector of the larger panel. It is likely that this panel had indicator lamps or potentiometers inserted into the holes.

395863	Transient waveform modifier, 1958 - 1962	2009/83/2	Transient waveform modifier (envelope shaper), custom built, metal / plastic / electronic components i/ glass, probably made by Tristram Cary, England, 1958-1962 This is a hand-built device known as a Transient Waveform Modifier. A transient is a voltage waveform that is generated to trigger the envelope of a sound. The envelope shapes the amplification of an oscillator over a short period of time so that it sounds like it has been produced as a musical sound. This is the contour of the sound and is normally thought of as having an attack, decay, sustain and release period (ADSR). It appears to have been custom built either by or for Tristram Cary and was used in his early studios back as far as, at least, the Fressingfield studio in Suffolk in the UK. It is a black metal panel with sixteen control knobs arranged in four rows of four, with a set of labels between the upper and lower pairs of rows. Electronically, it consists of four independent channels each of which utilises one row of control knobs. Each row consists of two multi-pole switches and two potentiometers. Each row is numbered, in cream paint, from 1 at the top to 4 at the bottom. In the back of the metal plate are the electronics for the four channels. These consist of the body of the switches and the potentiometers, an EF40 pentode audio amplifier valve, and the necessary passive electronic components to connect everything up and shape the currents so that the device works. Functionally, this device is a version of the envelope generator used in most analogue audio synthesisers. It has controls: The left most control is a 6 position switch that sets the degree of differentiation performed on the signal. Differentiation causes the signal to be sharpened up and may be thought of as the "attack" rate (slew rate) of the control voltage envelope. This control sets the rise time or 'attack' of the envelope. The second control is a three position switch which determines whether the envelope waveform triggered by the transient continues to 'grow' (or rise) or 'die' and drop away (or releases). The third control is a variable potentiometer that sets the duration of the active period of the envelope, that is, it sets the hold period of the note being shaped by this signal. The right most control is a potentiometer labelled Low Level Set and is the level of the voltage held during its interim period or the voltage that it remains at between transient events.

395761	Voltage controlled oscillator (VCO), 1962 - 1966	2009/83/1	Voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) with ring modulator, custom built, metal / plastic / electronic components, probably made by Tristram Cary, England, 1962-1966 This is probably a hand-built and very early version of a device known as a ring modulator. It consists of a voltage controlled oscillator (the device which is at the heart of all analogue audio synthesis equipment) with a number of presettable voltage setting potentiometers selected with a large rotary switch. It is mounted in a black metal plate (approx 40 x 45cm) with numerous controls built into it. Across the top it has two rows of 12 presettable potentiometers which are wired to a 30 position rotary switch. The switch is set up to select from any one of the presets, two very finely resolvable potentiometers having vernier controls or a further four external voltage inputs. In the centre of the panel is a rectangular plastic panel with a white surface in which the two vernier controls are mounted. On the regions of the surface around each there are traces of control position markers written in chinagraph pencil. There is a voltage level meter to the right hand of this central panel. Below there are, from left to right, a single control knob, a two position rotatable switch, three output jacks, three columns of three control knobs for setting amplitudes of a square wave and (what appear to be) two triangle or sawtooth wave oscillators. The outputs of the three oscillators are summed together to produce an output signal. These controls have arrows in strips of white tape running between them indicating the connections of the circuits and the signal flow between them. Many of the controls are marked with coloured paper dots to enable the user to distinguish which controls appear at which outputs or contribute to those output signals. There are also labels in dymotape at some of the controls which indicate their purpose. On the reverse are the working elements of the various control components, plus several circuit boards, the functions of which are controlled by these components. The circuit boards consist of two printed wiring assemblies, which are probably off-the-shelf oscillators, and two prototype circuits built on strip board (Vero board). Each has an array of electronic components consisting of transistors and passive devices soldered onto it. There is an array of wires which connect up the various devices.

396394	Mullard Australian GM4140A Measuring Bridge, 1939	2009/80/5	Measuring Bridge GM4140A, metal / plastic / wood / electronic components, made by Mullard Radio, Australia, 1939 This object is an instrument for measuring the capacitance or the resistance of passive components used in electronics. It is built into a timber box with leatherette covering. The front panel is in black Bakelite. It has three sockets for connecting probes at the top. The left hand and centre pair are used for Capacitance measurements and the right hand and centre pair are used for Resistance measurements. Below these is the Mullard Radio Australia logo and below that is a glass device that is a "null point". Two rotary controls in Bakelite with labelled backing dress are set below these. The left hand one is a Range switch for selecting the capacitance or resistance range values. The right hand control is for adjusting the sensitivity of the device when measuring in any of these ranges. Below these switches is a large black Bakelite rotary control with finger indents and a white Bakelite backing dress with a double scale for adjusting the percentage of accuracy of the measurements This device is a measuring bridge which indicates the value of a resistive or capacitive component by balancing the unknown component with known values of resistance or capacitance selected by the range switch, the sensitivity control and the percentage difference control. When a balance is reached the current flowing through the bride is nulled out and the arrangement that replaces the traditional galvanometer shows a null position. In this case this arrangement consists in a high-gain pentode valve amplifier, which gives the whole measuring bridge a very high input impedance, thus significantly reducing its load on the component being measured and rendering it far more accurate. The pentode amplifier output then drives an electron beam tube (cathode-ray tube) indicator - the glass device at centre-top - which shows the null point, or balance between the unknown component and the comparison circuit values by a finely focused line presented in the florescent surface of the glass indicator.

396755	Letters related to workplace suggestions, 1934 - 1956	2009/56/1	Letters and photographs, suggestions to improve workplace design and safety in electricity substations, Ronald Ball and Sydney County Council, paper, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia, 1934-1956 Dated 1934, photograph of Ronald George Ball, in suit and tie, with his wife and baby son outside a house. Dated 10 December 1937, and addressed to Mr R G Ball at 35 Arthur Street, Carlton, letter of appointment to the position of electrical fitter with the Sydney County Council Electricity Undertaking (SCC), signed by General Manager H R Forbes Mackay and typed on letterhead that includes a drawing of the Queen Victoria Building, at 457 George Street, where the SCC had its offices. The rate of pay was to be six pounds per week, and conditions of appointment included provision of a birth certificate, to ensure that the employee would 'cease to be a member of the Council's service upon reaching the age of sixty-five years'. The letter instructed Mr Ball to present himself to the Medical Officer on 14 December for a medical examination; a hand-written annotation in the margin notes 'fit' followed by the date 14.12.37 and initials, presumably of the Medical Officer. Dated 8 May 1950, handwritten letter from R Ball at West AC Sub Depot, Canterbury, addressed in formal style to the Chairman of the SCC Suggestions Board. The suggestion in the letter was designed to address the problem of emergency hand-operated winding gear in substations being compromised on occasion by theft of a chain that was necessary to its operation. The substations affected were part of the 33 kV distribution system containing 'F&P switchgear', which probably refers to equipment made by Ferguson and Pailin. The fix Ball suggested was to replace the chain with gears. Letters dated 18 March 1941, 2 April 1942, 15 December 1942, 22 August 1944, 10 April 1946, 17 October 1947, 13 November 1953, 4 August 1954, 24 May 1955 and 29 February 1956, addressed to Mr Ball. All letters are typed on letterhead, most bearing the SCC badge, which consists of the words THE SYDNEY COUNTY COUNCIL around a circle containing representations of the Sun (with the word HEAT), a fuel torch (with the word LIGHT) and a rearing horse (with the word POWER) and the words PERACTIS POSTERA PRAESTENT (which can be translated as 'Let the future excel the past') on a ribbon. Most are signed by General Managers: R Vine-Hall (1941 and 1942), DJ Nolan (1944 and 1946), GS Boyd (1947) and CE Ranger (1953, 1954 and 1956). One is signed by Deputy General Manager JCA Fraser (1955). They thank Mr Ball for a total of 11 suggestions, 10 of which were accepted. They commend him for his interest in his work, and refer to monetary rewards varying from two to ten pounds and totalling 46 pounds. The suggestions were assigned numbers from 737 (for one made in 1940 regarding electrostatic reconditioning of transformer oil, which led to in-house experiments and seeking of advice from overseas before it was rejected in 1942) to 2152 for the one accepted in 1956 (screening of low voltage switchboards in substations). Letter dated 19 June 1950, typed on plain paper and signed by substation engineer L V Molloy, thanking Mr Ball for his 'ingenuity and enthusiasm' in instigating a new approach to the application of end caps to busbars. Dated 1951, photograph of Ronald Ball, dressed in casual clothes, with his grand-daughter. Letter dated 29 February 1956, typed on letterhead paper, addressed to Mr Ball and signed by R Hahn, Secretary of the Suggestions Board. This letter acknowledges receipt of a suggestion for improved safety of apparatus earthing. Undated small SCC envelope, neither stamped nor franked, addressed to Mr R Ball, Maintenance Fitter, Substation Branch. This may have contained the February 1956 letter, which has the same form of address. The white envelope bears, in green: the word ELECTRICITY written vertically the full length of the left hand edge; return address for SCC at bottom left; and at top left a sketch of the head and hand of an elderly bespectacled woman with a finger on the switch of		1934 - 1956	: unknown; 1934 - 1956|		Business letters|Documents	http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=396755						This text content licensed under<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/au/" rel="license" about="http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=396755#_cc-by-sa_content">CC BY-SA</a>.

390790	Interdata 70 minicomputer, 1972	2009/41/1	Interdata 70 minicomputer, metal / plastic, made by Interdata Inc, Oceanport, New Jersey, United States of America, 1972, used by the Anglo-Australian Telescope, Coonabarabran, New South Wales, Australia, 1974-2008 The system consists of four rack mount cabinets and two free standing terminals, one of which is the original one while the other with the monitor is from the early 1980s. "The processor is an Interdata Model 70 minicomputer with the maximum 64Kb of core memory. This has a 16-bit word length, fast response to interrupts from up to 256 devices, 16 general purpose registers, and an extensive instruction set, including multiply, divide, and floating point operations. It is relatively fast; many instructions only take 1 microsecond. A 'memory protect' feature aids multiprogramming, where the memory partition of one program is protected against the activities of others. The control system uses 16- and 32-bit integer arithmetic and single precision floating point arithmetic. Nowhere does it have to resort to double precision point arithmetic despite the barely adequate 21-bit to 24-bit accuracy of single precision numbers. A wide range of peripherals is provided, including two disks, each of 2.5 million byte capacity, which are used continuously by the control system to move programs in and out of core, and a digital multiplexor I/O interface between the computer and most of the telescope devices."

389982	Coin toll collecting apparatus used on the Sydney Harbour Bridge, 1989	2009/37/1	Coin toll collecting apparatus used on the Sydney Harbour Bridge, including cabinet containing the coin mechanism and controllers, coin vault, local lane controller to operate exit lights, coin basket (3), Digital Equipment Corporation computer used to calibrate the coin validator device, patron fare indicator, exit light set, spare parts to maintain operation including pick-up wheels, actuators, escrow wheels, validators, solenoids, metal / plastic / electronic components, TST International, Brisbane, Australia/ Digital Equipment Corporation, United States of America, 1989 The coin collecting mechanism consists of a metal plate (platen) on which the coins are dropped by a feeder that leads from the collection basket. The platen spins and coins drop into slots specifically cut for each denomination. The coins are then given an electrical charge, which is read by a sensor. Because each denomination has its own signature, the coins are then verified and drop down into the vault. The vault sits beneath the coin collector, and consists of two coin drawers in a heavy case. The drawers have a one-way locking mechanism, closed when the drawer is removed from the vault case. The local lane controller is a switching device that is connected to the coin collection mechanism and the exit light that notifies the motorist when they may move from the toll plaza into traffic. The coin basket is a hard plastic funnel that sits on the outside of the apparatus and channels the coins into the coin mechanism. The fare indicator and exit light are electronically-lit sign boxes. The Digital Equipment Corporation computer coin validator device is of a ubiquitous PC appearance, though is a specialised computer.		1989	Maker: unknown; Brisbane, Queensland; 1989|	User: Roads and Traffic Authority of NSW; Sydney Harbour Bridge; 1989 - 2008|	Coin sorting machines|Transport-Land|Calculating Instruments|Electronics|Computers	http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=389982	810 mm	710 mm				This text content licensed under<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/au/" rel="license" about="http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=389982#_cc-by-sa_content">CC BY-SA</a>.

389384	Park drag coach, 1885 - 1886	2009/28/1	Coach, horsedrawn, park drag, timber / metal / cotton fabric, made by Vial & Sons, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia, probably 1886 A large four-wheeled enclosed carriage drawn by four horses, this example is capable of accommodating a driver and up to fourteen passengers with rear seat accommodation for two grooms. The "U" shaped body is suspended on two mail springs, the front and hind wheel and spring assemblies being joined by a perch. Two external dos-a-dos seats are mounted on the roof and one each on a front boot and hind boot which are used to store luggage and equipment for the road such as spare harness. The seats are upholstered in black vinyl, a close modern equivalent of the original leatherette trim. Non-original fittings include two coach lamps which were purchased by Mr Paul Greenaway. These were provided to add to the completeness and authentic appearance of the vehicle. The bodywork shows little sign of wear and appears to be mostly original. The wheels are mounted on common axles with hub caps. The spokes are staggered and the dished wheels are fitted with steel tyres. The coach is finished in brushed dark green and black paint. A pole and two swingle trees are provided for harnessing the hind horses but the spreader bar for the lead horses is missing. The interior is fitted with yellow ochre cloth button upholstery. Each window may be covered by a solid wooden panel shutter which slides up into place by means of a strap.	The brass hub caps bear the wording "VIAL & SONS BUILDERS SYDNEY" . The axle arms are stamped with the maker's name "Woodhead and Sons, Bradford, Yorkshire" with an emblem of an elephant and castle in a circle. A number "1885" or "1886" (almost certainly the year of manufacture of the axle) is adjacent to this.	1885 - 1886	Maker: Vial & Sons; Sydney, New South Wales; 1885 - 1886|		Horsedrawn coaches|Transport-Land	http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=389384						This text content licensed under<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/au/" rel="license" about="http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=389384#_cc-by-sa_content">CC BY-SA</a>.

385413	Bench lathe and box, 1800 - 1810	2009/1/1	Bench lathe with triangular bar bed, mandrel, tailstock with loose runner, hand rest with one tee, slide rest, attachment for converting lathe to back gear, foot wheel, and box, metal / wood, made by Henry Maudslay, England, c. 1805 Lathe consisting of various components with transportation box. The bar is made of cast iron. There is a long shallow notch in the bar just to right of neck, a poppit to clear the large chuck or workpiece and scars from cutting off of circular pouring gates or chucking pieces. The poppits for the mandrel are made of bronze. Their style corresponds to that of Lancashire clock lathes (but these are more commonly seen in iron) with mandrel carried between independent poppits fitted individually to the bar. The neck poppit has a steel plug with centre in, on the right face below the collar. The left poppit carries a plain runner for the tail of the mandrel, and a cock is screwed on to bear a screw, with lock nut, which urges the runner up. The runner is clamped in the same way as the tailstock runner. The mandrel and pulley are made of bronze with hardwood filling. No numerals seen. Numbers of divisions not counted. The cone has three steps with round-bottomed grooves suitable for 1/4 inch gut; these were turned round, and have not worn to that shape from vee grooves. Mandrel appears to be steel throughout with double-cone neck. The seat for the pulley is octagonal and tapered. The style of the pulley corresponds closely to that of a headstock signed Maudslay in the Institution of Mechanical Engineers (London). There is a brass sleeve on the tail of the mandrel, part of which has been cut up into a fine helix. The chuck is an American-style three inch three-jaw geared-scroll self-centring chuck, dating probably from the late 19th century. Loose poppit or tailstock has a reversible runner, with male and female centres. The poppit has some empty holes, indicating that other parts were once fitted to it. The Handrest locks to the bar in a way also reminiscent of Lancashire clock lathes: tightening the locking screw to lock the lower part to the bar also draws down a steel dovetail slip through two bolts which locks the slider to the lower part as well. The bronze slider is made up with separate jib pieces screwed or riveted with steel pins. The tee and its binding screw are steel. Several holes drilled into the lower block and into the slider, some tapped, indicate that other apparatus has been mounted to these parts. The slide rest, though unsigned, is undoubtedly by Maudslay and is of his usual pattern. The bronze base casting is clamped to the bed by steel bow nut and keeper. The lower slide has bronze gib pieces both sides which are adjustable, each having three setting-up screws and four binding screws which are numbered and correspond to numbers stamped adjacent to them. The slider is of cast iron. The steel lead screw is let in from above with caps that are flush, each held by two screws. The nut of brass or bronze is divided horizontally; the two parts united by two screws put in from below, and is fixed to the slider by two screws from above. The screw is very fine and extends to the rear about 13.5mm; this was intended to carry wheels for the screw-cutting apparatus with the slide mounted on a right angle extension piece (not present) so that this screw would be parallel to the lathe axis. This end of the screw now carries a brass or bronze worm wheel (36 teeth) 47.5mm in diameter. It was once secured by a cross pin, now absent. This would appear to be intended for an automatic feed to this motion of the rest, using other apparatus that is lost. The slider has six tapped holes on its centre line to receive the centre pin and binding screws of the upper slide. The centre pin is conical and has a slot for a screw driver. The upper slide has a bronze base which is capable of being set round to about 30 degrees each side of right-angles to the lower slide.

213661	Model of Royal Navy Frigate H.M.S. "Maidstone"	B319	Ship model, Admiralty Dockyard model, HMS "Maidstone", 28-gun, sixth rate, Coventry class frigate, wood / ivory, made by Stephen Bingle, Royal Naval Dockyard, Chatham, Kent, England, c. 1756 The model is thought to have been constructed of boxwood with ivory dead eyes, gantry, some railing, the steering wheel and the construction of the ship's bell. Part of the decks have been left out to show internal construction, including the design of the floor of the master cabin. Painted cherubs feature around the sides and stern of the model. The supporting base is decorated with gilt scrollwork. Two ivory columns support the frigate on the base. Other details include catheads, lanyards, gratings and a capstan. While the model was sent away for safe keeping during the Second World War, the rigging suffered some deterioration during storage. In 1944, George O. Ingledew made repairs to the model as follows: a new segment in the rim of the steering wheel and the wheel and standard was fixed to the deck; repairs and renewal to the guard rails on the quarter deck; repairs to the hand pump; a new platform in the main chains was made; and other items were fixed, including ladders, main companionway, porthole covers, platform for the capstan and various loose pieces. The scale is ¼ inch to 1 foot.

Built in 1920 the design was based on the New South Wales Government Railways (N.S.W.G.R.) S class tank engine, but there were major differences which included bar frames, a narrower firebox, a drumhead, an extended smokebox and outside bearing trucks. A clerical error was apparently made by an employee of Clyde Engineering in 1920 who assigned the same works (builder's) no. of 242 to two locomotives built by the company in 1920. One was the 'Iron Duke', and the other was No 1355 (later 5503) for the New South Wales Government Railways, (N.S.W.G.R.).

The image depicts a 4-6-4 side tank railway steam locomotive labelled 'IRON DUKE'. This locomotive was built by Clyde Engineering, works number 242, for Hoskins Iron and Steel Company Limited of Lithgow, to work its ironstone branch line from Spring Hill to Cadia in central-western New South Wales. Built in 1920 the design was based on the New South Wales Government Railways (N.S.W.G.R.) S class tank engine, but there were major differences which included bar frames, a narrower firebox, a drumhead, an extended smokebox and outside bearing trucks. A clerical error was apparently made by an employee of Clyde Engineering in 1920 who assigned the same works (builder's) no. of 242 to two locomotives built by the company in 1920. One was the 'Iron Duke', and the other was No 1355 (later 5503) for the New South Wales Government Railways, (N.S.W.G.R.).
